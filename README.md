## Preface
First of all, I would like to thank AtmaGaming for the opportunity, and emphasize that I am available to talk specifically about each item included in the test.

## Game Settings
Thinking about the sustainability of the prototype, few attributes were placed in a way that they cannot be changed. With this, below is a list of what can be configured, and how this can be done.

### Game Mode
Let's start with Game Mode.

GameMode was created to make the game's difficulty variable, which in the case of our prototype, involves some questions you can ask yourself before you actually start playing. For example:

• How many enemies do I want to spawn at once?

• How long does it take for these enemies to spawn?

• Which enemy do I want to fight?

To do this, I made some variables visible and variable, as shown in the image below.

### PlayerShip
Regarding the player's ship, it is important to note that I separated the systems into components, so that they can be used for other purposes, as in this example, the same systems were used for the enemies.

We will talk about each system below

#### Weapon System
The Weapon System has a few visible variables, but they can give life and dynamics to the game.

#### Health System 
The Health System works in the same way

### Enemies
Based on the instructions given, I dedicated myself to making just one enemy.

In it, we have the same settings as the player, since the systems were made in a way that could also be used by the AI. That said, to configure it, just base it on the configuration of the players' systems.
